### Hello there 👋🏻

I'm a Full-stack Java developer and occasional Python/C++ AI engineer who loves the idea of spotting subtle problems in our daily lives and using programming/scripts to either fix them or make the process better. I'm also interested in cloud technologies, AI, and philosophy.</br>
